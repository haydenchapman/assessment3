        <div class="goals">
            <h3>Goals:</h3>
            Basically I have been programming at an amateur enthusiast level for a while now and with my time at
            DevMountain, I would really like to hone my skills to a professional level and quality. 
            I have been on robotics teams where I was exposed to programming and have taken other classes on programming previously in my life. 
            <br>
            My my goal is to land a job either locally in DFW or remote as a software developer in some capacity.
            My dream would be to work in the auto, airline, or gaming sectors.
            I really enjoy technology and I would like to use my skilss in software and engineering to make the world a better place.
